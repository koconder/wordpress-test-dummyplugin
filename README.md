# Wordpress Dummy Plugin

This is a purpose-built dummy plugin part of the [Wordpress Unit Testing Suite](https://github.com/koconder/wordpress-test-template) for Unit Testing and CI compatibility for Wordpres plugins and themes.

This dummy plugin is based on the work from [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) which was started in 2011 by [Tom McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) and has since included a number of great contributions. In March of 2015 the project was handed over by Tom to Devin Vinson.

The current version of the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) was developed in conjunction with [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". However this plugin is used for Unit Testing ass part of [Wordpress Unit Testing Suite](https://github.com/koconder/wordpress-test-template)
